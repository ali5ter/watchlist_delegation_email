Beacon Delegation Email
=======================

An admin can delegate the action on a VM alert via email.

The email should reflect the alert details, the VM and any bookmarked solutions (KB Articles & web pages).

**This email content needs to work in all email clients when they're enabled for HTML.**

So that:
* Table, not CSS, layout
* Simple in-line styles only
* No background images
* No image sizing
* Alt attributes on all images

Images will either have to be served off vmware.com so they're accessible to external customers or we have to embed them.

It is safer to create mutipart mime email bodies that containt a plain text alternative to the HTML email but not sure how we do that from our smartphone email clients.
